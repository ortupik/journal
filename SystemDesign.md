## 5. Ollama AI Implementation

### 5.1 Ollama Setup

Ollama is designed to run locally on the user's device, ensuring privacy and speed for AI processing.

#### Installation

Install Ollama on your Mac or Linux system using the following command:

```sh
curl -fsSL [https://ollama.ai/install.sh](https://ollama.ai/install.sh) | sh
```

#### Running Ollama Model (Example: Llama 3 - Consider Phi as an alternative)

To start Ollama with a specific model, for example, phi or llama3 *(I used Phi 2.5B)*:

```sh
ollama run phi
   # OR
ollama run llama3

```

Ensure the desired model ( `phi` or `llama3`) is pulled by Ollama.

## 6. Authentication & Security

‚úÖ **JWT Authentication (Stored in HTTP-only cookies):** Provides secure and stateless authentication for API requests after user login. HTTP-only cookies mitigate the risk of client-side JavaScript accessing the token.

‚úÖ **Bcrypt for Password Hashing:** Securely stores user passwords by using a strong hashing algorithm with salt.

‚úÖ **OAuth Support via NextAuth.js:** Enables users to authenticate using third-party providers like Google and GitHub, reducing the need to manage passwords directly.

‚úÖ **CSRF Protection for API Requests:** Protects against cross-site request forgery attacks by using techniques like synchronizer tokens. Next.js and NextAuth.js often provide built-in mechanisms for this.

‚úÖ **Rate Limiting for Login Attempts:** Prevents brute-force attacks on user accounts by limiting the number of login attempts from a specific IP address within a certain timeframe.

‚úÖ **Input Validation:** Implemented robust server-side validation on all incoming data to prevent injection attacks Use zod library for schema validation.

‚úÖ **HTTPS Enforcement:** *(TODO)* Ensure that the application is served over HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the client and the server, protecting sensitive data in transit.

‚úÖ **Dependency Management:***(TODO)* Keep all dependencies (Node.js libraries, Prisma, Next.js) up-to-date to benefit from security patches without breaking the application due to mismatch

‚úÖ **Cloudflare Bot Detection:** *(TODO)* Integrate Cloudflare's bot detection to identify malicious traffic and prevent it from reaching the application


## 7. Scaling Considerations

### 7.1 Why Ollama is Scalable

- **Local AI Processing:** Offloads AI computation from the backend servers to individual user devices, eliminating per-request AI costs.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** As the user base grows, the AI processing scales with the number of users and their devices, rather than requiring more powerful central servers.
- **Edge Caching:** Next.js Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) can cache responses that might involve AI computations, reducing the need for repeated processing.

### 7.2 Additional Optimizations

- **Indexes:** Implementing an index on the `userId` column in the `Journals` table will significantly speed up data retrieval for specific users.
- **Partitioning:** For very large datasets, consider partitioning the `Journals` table based on the `createdAt` timestamp to improve query performance.
- **Read Replicas:** Setting up PostgreSQL read replicas can enhance read availability and distribute the load on the primary database.

### 7.3 Scaling to Support 1M+ Users

To support 1M+ active users, the following scaling strategies would be crucial:

- **Horizontal Scaling of Backend:** Deploy multiple instances of the Next.js backend API behind a load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, Nginx). Ensure the API is stateless.
- **Database Scaling:**
    - **Read Replicas:** Significantly increase the number of read replicas to handle the increased read traffic.
    - **Database Partitioning:** Implement robust partitioning strategies on the `Journals` table based on `userId` or `createdAt` to distribute data and query load.
    - **Consider Sharding:** For extreme scale, consider database sharding, where the database is split across multiple independent servers. This adds complexity but can handle massive datasets.
- **Caching:** Implement a comprehensive caching strategy using Redis for frequently accessed data and computation results. Optimize cache invalidation strategies.
- **CDN for Static Assets:** Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront to serve static assets (JavaScript, CSS, images) closer to users, reducing latency and load on the backend servers.
- **Asynchronous Task Processing:** For non-critical background tasks (e.g., generating historical summaries), use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) and worker processes to avoid blocking API requests.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to track key metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, database performance, error rates) and proactively identify and address potential issues.

## 8. Potential Bottlenecks and How to Address Them
- **AI Processing locally :** Users with older or less powerful devices might experience less accurate AI processing using the current **Phi 2.5B** model that I used. I also used an **11th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU** without GPU for development and testing, which provided a less than satsifactory perfomance.
    - **Solution:** Recommend upgrading to a device with an **Nvidia GPU** featuring **CUDA Cores** and exploring more powerful models like **llama 4B** or **phi 6.1B** for improved accuracy. If performance is still a concern, consider using bigger paid cloud-based AI integration.
- **Database Read/Write Performance:** With a large number of users and entries, the PostgreSQL database could become a bottleneck.
    - **Solution:** Implement indexing, partitioning, read replicas, and potentially sharding as described in the scaling section. Optimize database queries.
- **Backend API Processing:** Handling a large volume of API requests could strain the backend servers.
    - **Solution:** Horizontal scaling of the backend API behind a load balancer. Optimize API endpoints and code for performance. Implement caching.

    - **Solution:** Clearly communicate system requirements. Offer the optional cloud-based AI integration for users who need more power or prefer not to run AI locally.
- **Network Latency:** Users geographically distant from the backend servers might experience higher latency.
    - **Solution:** Utilize a CDN to serve static assets closer to users. Deploy backend API instances in multiple geographic regions if necessary.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Incorrect cache invalidation can lead to stale data.
    - **Solution:** Implement effective cache invalidation strategies based on data changes.
- **TODO Cloudflare Bot Detection:** Implement Cloudflare's Bot Detection to protect against malicious traffic.

## 9. Components That Might Need Redesign at Scale

- **Database Schema:** As the application evolves and data requirements change at scale, the database schema might need to be redesigned for better performance and scalability (e.g., further normalization or denormalization, different data types).
- **API Endpoints:** Some API endpoints might become inefficient at scale. They might need to be redesigned to support pagination, filtering, and more efficient data retrieval. Consider using GraphQL for more flexible data fetching.
- **Real-time Features:** If real-time features (e.g., collaborative journaling) are added, the architecture would need to incorporate technologies like WebSockets and potentially a dedicated real-time communication service.
- **Search Functionality:** Basic database queries might become too slow for searching through a large number of journal entries. A dedicated search engine like Elasticsearch might be necessary.

### Decision 1: AI Processing Location

- **Problem:** How to integrate AI capabilities while prioritizing user privacy and minimizing backend costs.
- **Options Considered:**
    - **Cloud-based AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google Cloud AI):** Powerful AI models, easy to integrate initially.
    - **On-device AI processing (Ollama):** Enhanced privacy, lower latency, no per-request costs.
    - **Hybrid approach:** Use cloud AI for some tasks and local AI for others.
- **Chosen Approach:** On-device AI processing with Ollama as the primary solution.
- **Rationale:** Prioritizes user privacy by keeping journal data local. Reduces backend costs associated with AI API calls. Offers offline functionality.
- **Trade-offs and Consequences:** Requires users to install and run Ollama locally, which might be a barrier for some. Local AI models might have limitations compared to the most advanced cloud models. Initial setup might be slightly more involved for the user.

### Decision 2: Backend Framework

- **Problem:** Choosing a backend framework that supports full-stack development, efficient API creation, and server-side rendering.
- **Options Considered:**
    - **Express.js:** Minimalist framework, highly flexible.
    - **Next.js:** Full-stack framework with built-in support for routing, server-side rendering, API routes, and more.
    - **NestJS:** Progressive Node.js framework with a structured architecture (Angular-like).
- **Chosen Approach:** Next.js.
- **Rationale:** Enables rapid development with its full-stack capabilities. Server-side rendering improves initial load times and SEO. API routes simplify backend development. Large and active community.
- **Trade-offs and Consequences:** Can have a steeper learning curve compared to basic Express.js for simple APIs. The "magic" of Next.js can sometimes make debugging more complex.

### Decision 3: Database ORM

- **Problem:** Selecting an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Options Considered:**
    - **Sequelize:** Mature and widely used ORM.
    - **TypeORM:** TypeScript-first ORM with decorator-based syntax.
    - **Prisma:** Modern ORM with a focus on developer experience, type safety, and database migrations.
- **Chosen Approach:** Prisma.
- **Rationale:** Provides excellent type safety, auto-generated database client, and a smooth migration process. Developer-friendly schema definition and querying.
- **Trade-offs and Consequences:** Relatively newer compared to Sequelize, but has gained significant traction. The Prisma schema is specific to Prisma.

### Decision 4: Authentication Strategy

- **Problem:** Implementing a secure and scalable authentication mechanism.
- **Options Considered:**
    - **Session-based authentication:** Simple to implement initially but can be challenging to scale for stateless APIs.
    - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Stateless, scalable, suitable for microservices.
- **Chosen Approach:** JWT Authentication stored in HTTP-only cookies, combined with OAuth via NextAuth.js.
- **Rationale:** JWT provides a stateless and scalable authentication mechanism. HTTP-only cookies enhance security by preventing client-side JavaScript access to the token. OAuth simplifies user onboarding by allowing login with existing accounts.
- **Trade-offs and Consequences:** JWT requires careful management of the secret key. Revoking tokens can be more complex than invalidating sessions (though short-lived tokens and refresh tokens mitigate this).

## Code Quality Focus Areas

- **Test Coverage:** Implement comprehensive test suites including:
    - **Unit Tests (Jest):** Test individual functions and components in isolation to ensure they behave as expected. Aim for high code coverage in critical areas.
    - **Integration Tests (Supertest/Playwright):** Test the interaction between different parts of the system, such as API endpoints interacting with the database.
    - **End-to-End Tests (Playwright):** Simulate real user scenarios to verify the complete application flow, covering UI interactions and backend logic.
- **Error Handling Strategies:**
    - Implement robust error handling in backend API routes to catch exceptions gracefully.
    - Return meaningful error messages to the client, including appropriate HTTP status codes.
    - Log errors on the server for debugging and monitoring.
    - Implement client-side error handling to provide informative feedback to the user.
    - Use try-catch blocks and specific error type handling where appropriate.
- **Performance Optimization Techniques:**
    - Implement database query optimization (indexing, efficient queries).
    - Utilize caching (Redis, Next.js ISR) to reduce database load and improve response times.
    - Optimize frontend code for rendering performance (code splitting, lazy loading).
    - Compress assets (images, CSS, JavaScript).
    - Monitor application performance and identify bottlenecks using tools like Datadog or New Relic.
- **Code Architecture, Documentation, and Organization:**
    - Follow a clear and consistent code style (e.g., using ESLint and Prettier).
    - Organize code into logical modules and directories based on functionality (e.g., `pages/api`, `lib`, `components`).
    - Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
    - Document API endpoints (ideally with Swagger/OpenAPI).
    - Maintain a well-structured project with clear separation of concerns (e.g., data access layer, business logic layer, presentation layer).
    - Use meaningful variable and function names.
    - Keep functions and components small and focused.
    - Follow SOLID principles where applicable.


## 8. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests (Jest):** Focus on testing the core logic of individual components and utility functions.
